          <h1>El Mundo en Orbyt</h1>
          <p>Orbyt is the first spanish multi-format digital news-stand where you can access all the information within a variety of leading publications in Spain.</p>

          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>The objective of the client was to analyze the degree of usability and accessibility of El Mundo within the platform Orbyt (web access).</p>
          <p>For this, both usability and accessibility studies, were carried out</p>

          <h2>Usability study</h2>
          <p>The newspaper El Mundo was evaluated in the Orbyt platform, while accessing through the web in a personal computer. The evaluation covers the essential content of the newspaper (photos and texts from the printed version), the access site, the multimedia content and the pop-ups resulting from interaction with any of the previous parts.</p>
          <p>The usability evaluation was carried out in two parts: an evaluation with users and an evaluation of usability heuristics.</p>
          <p>At the end, an analysis and a report of the results were delivered to the client.</p>

          <h3>Evaluation with user</h3>
          <p>Firstly, an analysis of the usage context has been carried out, which includes information about users, tasks and environment.</p>
          <p>Secondly, a list of eight tasks to be done by users recruited for testing was defined. These tasks range from familiarizing with the interface, to more complex functions such as finding and finding difficult-to-view articles, managing notes and bookmarks, working with different display modes, and making use of social networking options.</p>
          <p>From these eight tasks, a protocol was defined for the user tests, which includes welcome information, description of the tasks that the user has to perform, data collection during the execution of the tasks, questionnaire on aspects of usability and, finally, a brief interview.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, four pilot tests with users had carried out, which served to refine the evaluation process, from the list of tasks to be performed to possible errors in the documents used in the evaluations as well as in the procedure used.</p>
          <p>Fourth, users were recruited to fit the profile needed. It was possible to recruit 45 users.</p>
          <p>Finally, we performed the usability tests with the 45 users, taking data and obtaining all the information that seemed relevant. Each user spends, on average, an hour to perform the tests and answer the questionnaires.</p>

          <h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>
          <p>On the other hand it was decided to complement this user-based evaluation with a heuristic evaluation that has followed the 10 heuristics of Jakob Nielsen.</p>

          <h2>Accessibility study</h2>
          <p>The objective was to evaluate the accessibility of the online newspaper El Mundo through its web platform for presentation to the end user called Orbyt.</p>
          <p>The accessibility requirements set out in the World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation WCAG 2.0 (World Content Accessibility Guidelines) were applied. This document defines four principles, 12 guidelines and 61 criteria for success. Each criterion has a level of conformity associated, which can be A (the most important), AA or AAA (the least important).</p>
          <p>In this study, the scope of the study covered up to the AA level. This level was chosen as the minimum required by law in official governmental pages.</p>
          <p>As in the usability study, an analysis and a report of the results were also delivered to the client.</p>
