          <p>DV Business Solutions, a division of The Digital Virgo group, offered Software as a Service (SAAS) products to other companies to manage the communication with their customers.</p>

          <p>Over the years they had accumulated a catalog of disparate products that made the experience slow and complex to use. To catch up with competitors the goals were to increase sales and use while minimizing resources.</p>

          <h2>My role.</h2>
          <p>The initial team consisted of me and a Product Manager (PM), working closely on an ambitious long-term project to unify seven siloed but interrelated products into a single solution.</p>

          <p>Initially, I had a dual role as a UX designer and frontend engineer, but as the project progressed, it became clear that delegating tasks and responsibilities was necessary. This led to the growth of the team with new members coming on board to help with the project. This allowed me to specialize in UX design and develop my skills further.</p>

          <p>I led the frontend development of the unification from April 2016 to September 2017, after which I delegated most of the frontend work to a new developer. Similarly, a new visual designer took over the detailed visual design during 2018.</p>

          <p>In May 2019, I left the project to pursue my masters in <a href="../resume.html">Human-Computer Interaction & Design</a>. At that time, the team was about to begin development of the <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Supervisor</em> as we had already entered the detailed visual design phase.

          <h3>Scope and constraints.</h3>
          <p>Most of the seven independent products were originally created by different departments, teams, or were acquired from other companies. As a result, they had different technology stacks, often with a legacy nature, which sometimes limited the feasibility of new ideas.</p>

          <p>Given the magnitude of time needed for this project, the company could not afford to leave the current products as they were until the new product was released. Therefore, incremental changes were introduced to satisfy business requirements, improve the user experience, and ease the learning curve for the future merged product.</p>

          <p>Moreover, due to the company policy, I was unable to access external users, except for some exceptional surveys. As a result, I mostly collaborated with our internal users, including contact center agents, support staff, and commercial staff who relayed customer feedback.</p>

          <h2>The discovery.</h2>
          <h3>Landing in the customer relationship ecosystem.</h3>
          <p>The first few weeks as a newcomer to the customer relationship ecosystem were intense. It took some time to analyze all the different products the company had and to familiarize myself with new concepts and jargon.</p>

          <p class="card">To help you follow along, I will include explanation cards for industry concepts when relevant.</p>

          <h3>Personas.</h3>
          <p>There was a significant variety of users, ranging from dentists who only needed to send reminder messages to patients via SMS to companies that resold our contact center products to other companies under a white-label model, and everyone in between.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/Personas.png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption">Our four different archetypes of personas. 3 primary personas using our product professionally and one secondary persona (bottom right) using it casually to support his business.</em>

          <h3>First mission: QoS.</h3>
          <p>My first mission was to create a tool to manage the Quality of Service (QoS) that our customers provided, in turn, to their customers.</p>

          <p class="card">Quality of service (QoS) is the description and measurement of the overall performance seen by the users of a service.</p>

          <p>Users could define questions to obtain feedback on the quality of service provided. These questions were asked by the end of the phone call, after having provided a service, and their customers would have the option to answer them. Users could also see this feedback and all the responses associated with each question.</p>

          <p>I began by conducting a non-exhaustive competitive analysis, mostly based on web tools, due to limited access to telephony-based ones.</p>

          <p>The design quickly scaled up to support more business needs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Templates of predefined questions commonly used in the industry (such as First Call Resolution, Net Promoter Score, etc.) to speed up setup.</li>
            <li>Different types of questions (Yes/No, 1 to 10 score, etc.)</li>
            <li>Information from call metadata, such as the number of calls, surveys started and completed, survey average time, etc.</li>
            <li>Ability to define business hours, holidays, telephone numbers, and phone tree paths to determine whether or not to carry out the survey.</li>
            <li>and more</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="card">Phone tree, or an <a href="https://www.zendesk.fr/blog/what-is-ivr/#georedirect">Interactive Voice Response</a> (IVR), is an automated phone system tool that answers incoming customer calls and offers options for next steps via a menu. It uses these responses to route customers to the right agent or department, etc.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/QoS_Design_iterations.png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption">Design iterations exploring the home, edit and results screens. The latter adds more features and shifts the posture from individual results, to a dashboard.</em>

          <h2>The challenge.</h2>
          <p>Using multiple products made the user experience more complex, slow, and cumbersome. With different accounts and logins, interfaces, and behaviors, in addition to complex text and design, users often had to repeatedly enter redundant data and deal with an unappealing aesthetic.</p>

          <p>As a result, users found it difficult to focus on their businesses when they had to spend significant time and effort learning and using a multitude of disparate and complex tools.</p>

          <h3>Users and Customer feedback.</h3>
          <p class="quote">"[I need] Improvements in the visualization of the display, monitoring..."</p>

          <p class="quote">"I believe that the administration should be improved in terms of usability and errors."</p>

          <p class="quote">"The portal is quite old and I have no time to manage the services. It deserves an update."</p>

          <p class="quote">"[I need] Easier virtual switchboard programming."</p>

          <p class="quote">"The poor virtual switchboard, it looks old."</p>

          <p class="quote">"From software maker to software maker, this... is pretty dated."</p>

          <h3>Introducing the problem of redundancy and the solution of Single Sign-On (SSO) and the merge.</h3>
          <p>Our goal was to increase sales and usage while minimizing resources. To achieve this, we needed to create streamlined tools and efficient workflows that minimize setup and maintenance time, allowing users to focus on their business operations.</p>

          <p>For example, in the previous case, users had to introduce telephone numbers, business hours, and holidays. When they didn't remember this information, which was usually the case, they had to use another existing tool where they had already defined the same information. They had to log in to this other tool, look for the information they needed, and come back to the QoS tool to finally add it. This process was inefficient and time-consuming.</p>

          <p>Wouldn't it be easier to provide this information directly in the new QoS tool and the only task they would need to do is select the right value? Luckily, my Product Manager was aligned with this vision and we fought for it. To solve this problem of redundancy, we proposed the solution of Single Sign-On (SSO) and the merge.</p>

          <p>In a first stage with SSO, users only would need to log in once, and they can access multiple products with a single set of credentials. This streamlined the login process, reducing the need to remember multiple login credentials.</p>

          <p>Additionally, we proposed the merge of the seven independent products to create a unified platform with a consistent interface, behavior, and design. This would
          reduce the complexity of users' work and make it more efficient.</p>

          <h3>Breaking down and analyzing to find the pieces of the puzzle.</h3>

          <p>To reduce redundancy and improve the information architecture, I analyzed our products and broke them down into their individual parts. This involved clustering products based on their functionality and examining their units of operation.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/CardSorting.png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption">Post workshop analysis</em>

          <p>By identifying areas of overlap and commonality between products, I gained valuable insights for improving our overall information architecture.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/SmartContact_Architecture.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption">Cluster of different products functionality by its work nature</em>

          <h2>The vision.</h2>
          <h3>All in one solution.</h3>
          <p>The vision for a unified product, <strong>Smart</strong>Contact, was composed of two major tools: <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Supervisor</em> and <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Supervisor</em> allowed customers to set up, manage and configure their communications.</li>
            <li><strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em> enabled, both inbound and outbound, direct communication with their clients. It had to provide tools for the agent to perform their work optimally.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Therefore, I was designing for both Business to Business (B2B) and Business to Customer (B2C) situations.</p>

          <p>Although the goal was to merge all seven isolated products into one, business requirements demanded faster time-to-market. As a result, new tools such as QoS and Agent were still offered independently while existing ones were improved.</p>

          <h2>The approach.</h2>
          <p>The approach to developing SmartContact was twofold. For For <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em>, we adopted a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
          approach with an iterative process to meet customer demands and business needs. We released a new product with basic functionality that would quickly evolve incorporating new features.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/whiteboards.png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption"></em>

          <p>For <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Supervisor</em> we tackle two parallel but shifted fronts, where one started before the other and provided feedback to later. We began by introducing changes to the existing products to improve their current usability, test new concepts, validate our approach to it and gauge feedback. This allowed us to explore in order to find the optimal way to later structure and integrate it into the <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Supervisor</em> as a cohesive whole.</p>

          <p>By taking this approach, we were able to refine and test our ideas before fully integrating them into the <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Supervisor</em>. This allowed us to develop a more effective and cohesive product that satisfied user needs.</p>

          <h3><strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em>.</h3>
          <p>Our goal was to make our product, originally designed for contact center agents to work on landline telephones, more accessible by moving it to the cloud. We aimed to create a browser-based solution that streamlined the user experience without requiring additional software. Both versions, the existing tool and the new cloud-based solution, had to coexist.</p>

          <p>The traditional contact center agent tool consisted of a landline telephone for agents to communicate with customers. Agents could perform some interactions with their dial pads, such as putting calls on hold or transferring them, and
          change their status from "Working" to "Pause" when idle.</p>

          <p>To improve the product, I conducted an exhaustive competitive analysis on other similar products to identify different features and common structures.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/SmartContact Agent - Market competitors.png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption">Different competitors software extracted from the competitive analysis</em>

          <p>We adopted a minimum viable product approach to develop the new <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em> which needed to include:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>a softphone for inbound and outbound calls</li>
            <p class="card">A softphone is a software program for making telephone calls over the Internet using a general purpose computer rather than dedicated hardware. It is usually used with a headset connected to the sound card of the PC or with a USB phone.</p>
            <li>the ability to integrate the Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) logic</li>
            <p class="card">An automatic call distributor (ACD), is a telephony device that answers and distributes, based on parameters, incoming calls to a specific group of terminals or agents within an organization.</p>
            <li>the ability to manage the agent status</li>
            <li>and finally the ability to show a frame displaying some kind of web content associated with each call.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>However, expanding our existing tool to a new web-based version brought new challenges, such as inconsistent status changes and limited space for relevant content in the telemarketing tool. We tackled these issues with a redesign of other tools and discovered new challenges that led to the ideation of new concepts, such as a classification system and a LITE version of the <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em> for customers with a customer service management tool.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/Test A.png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption"><strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em> lite paper prototype test</em>

          <h3><strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Supervisor</em>.</h3>
          <p>Most of the features that were gradually being incorporated into <strong>Smart</strong>Contact <em>Agent</em> modifications or an additional place in the existing management product to manage them effectively.</p>

          <p>This also led us to focus on improving the quality of our monitoring and statistics services since this information is crucial for contact center managers to maintain high performance. The monitoring service allowed managers to detect issues in real-time and react accordingly. For example, they could identify a spike in calls due to technical problems or an agent taking too long on a call. Meanwhile, the statisticsprovided medium to long-term insights to evaluate performance at a higher level of the business.</p>

          <h4>Tradeoffs to meet stakeholder needs.</h4>
          <p>Balancing the needs of multiple stakeholders is a complex process that requires careful consideration and collaboration.  We worked with a wide range of stakeholders —from development teams to financial and commercial departments—  each with their own interests. Meeting everyone's requirements was not easy, and we all had to make some tradeoffs.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/balancing_stakeholders_needs.png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">

          <p>Through a series of analyses and discussions, we were able to identify the 80% most used and relevant features and functionalities we would continue with. This led to a reduction in complexity and scope, which allowed us to create a more coherent and natural design. While this meant that some features were left out or postponed, it allowed us to focus on the most critical ones that would have the greatest impact on meeting stakeholder needs.</p>

          <h4>Designing a flexible platform at the macro level.</h4>
          <p>Our team recognized the diverse needs and interests of our user personas, which prompted us to iterate extensively until we determined that a module-based platform with significant customizability was the best solution. While some clients only needed SMS sending or a few agents to make manual calls to their customers, others had to manage thousands of agents conducting marketing campaigns or providing customer support services.</p>

          <p>We knew that the platform had to be flexible enough to handle these varying degrees of complexity while still providing a simple and intuitive experience for all users. By segmenting the platform into modules, users could contract modules according to their needs, which also eased accounting and billing processes for the financial department. This ultimately resulted in a platform that could scale to meet the demands of the most diverse business operations and activities.</p>

          <em class="img-caption">The new product architecture where we extracted commonality between our old products to ground levels and their features became modules in the merged final product.</em>

          <h4>Designing for flexibility at micro level.</h4>
          <p>We recognized that creating a dashboard to suit all users was a challenging task given their varying needs and task nature. Our initial efforts came close, but either we were unable to offer the required information to some users or we made it too complicated and difficult to use.</p>

          <p>After several unsuccessful attempts, we realized that the best solution was to provide users with the flexibility to build their own dashboard from scratch, enabling them to customize it to their specific tasks andpreferences.</p>

          <img src="/aneiser_website/img/dv/[styleguide.bmpr].png" class="img-responsive" alt="design process">
          <em class="img-caption">Exploration of different charts and visual elements to best convey relevant information and to be used on the dashboard widgets.</em>

          <p>Developing a customizable dashboard was a challenging process, but it was ultimately worth it. The end result was a interactive dashboard that was both intuitive and adaptable, providing users with the tools they needed to be more efficient and productive in their work.</p>

          <h2>Reflection.</h2>
          <h3>Future work.</h3>
          <p>The iterative approach we chose for SmartContact Agent, which involves a Minimum Viable Product that evolves over time, could potentially result in a design by accretion that may need to be reviewed. As new features and functionalities are added in response to user feedback, there is a risk that the design may become more complex and less cohesive.Therefore, it is important to periodically assess the design and make any necessary changes to ensure that it remains effective and highly usable.</p>
