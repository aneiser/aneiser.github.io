          <h1>Standalone HERA</h1>
          <p>HERA is a semi-automatic accessibility evaluation tool originated from the Firefox plugin HERA-FFX</p>

          <h2>Hera-FFX usability problems</h2>
          <p>What made a tool that presents many of the features desired by web accessibility consultants that use it was a tedious job? The answer was clear. A usability well below average and clearly improveable.</p>
          <p>But wait, how do I knew that? Well, I got to work! I conducted an usability problems analysis</p>
          <p>This analysis consisted of three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</li>
            <li>An AttrakDiff Survey</li>
            <li>Coments from users</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</h3>
          <p>10 statements. 5 positives and 5 negatives to which the user must respond on a scale from 1 to 5 what is his o her level of agreement with each sentence. This results in a score</p>
          <p>The average score of more than 500 SUS studies is 68. Hera-FFX scored 53,5. According to the percentile range Hera-FFX did not reach a D. Which means it failed the survey.</p>

          <p style="color:red;">SUS chart ALT</p>


          <h3>AttrakDiff Survey</h3>
          <p>28 pairs of opposing concepts valued as positive or negative. Complicated Vs. Simple, Ugly vs. Attractive, etc.</p>
          <p>The user indicates which concept is closer to his or her perception and how close it is.</p>
          <p>Half of the concepts were positives and the other half negatives.</p>

          <h3>Comments from users</h3>
          <p>The comments were collected through free response questions. In general those were negatives.</p>
          <p>It takes a too much time, To much clicks are needed, the UI is ugly and obsolete, the tools is not friendly are some examples.</p>
          <p>Only one user, among 57 young europeans, said positives comments.</p>
          <p>As a result, a series of improvements proposals were made. Those proposals were focus on efficiency, automatisms, accessibility, help and feedback and graphic design.</p>

          <h2>Context of Use Analysis</h2>
          <p>This analysis consisted of three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users</li>
            <li>Task</li>
            <li>Enviroment</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Users</h3>
          <p>I needed to know which were their characteristic and necessities</p>
          <p>I used Personas technique. It led me to set up two clearly defined user profiles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Andrea as an expert user</li>
            <li>Nicol√°s as an novice user</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Task</h3>
          <p>I also needed to know what the tasks of users of this kind of tools usually are: Browse, begin an automatic evaluation, test success criteria... How they were organized, etc.</p>
          <p>I designed two different scenarios with essentials tasks.</p>

          <h3>Enviroment</h3>
          <p>Although there were restrictions none of them were especially relevant to be mentioned at this point.</p>

          <h2>Low fidelity prototype</h2>
          <p>Previous to design the low fidelity protoype a design scheme which characteristics satisfied many of the needs, as well as a Navigation map in order to describe the <acronym title="Information architecture">IA</acronym> and conect the interaction contexts were proposed</p>
          
          <h3>Layout scheme</h3>
          <img src="../img/work/hera/main_ui_interaction_context.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width: 70%; margin: auto;" alt="SUS chart">
          <p style="color:red;">Main UI interaction context ALT</p>

          <h3>Navigation map</h3>

          <h3>Paper-based prototype</h3>
          <p>Now you can see some screens from the prototype used for the usability tests. It developed the scenarios. The user interacted with it by tapping the elements.</p>

          <p style="color:red;">lofi_proto ALT</p>

          <h2>User tests</h2>
          <p>The user tests were conducted by one facilitator and an observer.</p>
          <p>In the test we studied the interaction of 5 people with the low fidelity prototype. 3 of them were acessibility experts and 2 novices students.</p>
          <p>We got ready the tasks list, the surveys, the observer sheet and we even made an evaluation protocol. Oh! there was a pilot test too.</p>

          <h2>Get to the point. Results</h2>
          <p>I'm going to keep the same structure in order to facilitate the comparison. Let's recap:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</li>
            <li>The AttrakDiff Survey</li>
            <li>The coments from users</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</h3>
          <p>The Hera-FFX average scored was 53,5. Hera standalone got an average of 65,6.</p>
          <p>This mean 7,5 points more, an improvement of 12% in the percentil range. Now it get slightly over C, which mean Standalone Hera pass it, and almost reach the SUS average.</p>
          <p>But let's calm down. It is needed to realize that these surveys were made with a considerable smaller sample. It is less representative. Also, we are comparing a prototype with closed task and less time of use with a real tool with real taks and more, more time of use.</p>

          <p style="color:red;">SUS chart ALT</p>
          
          <h3>AttrakDiff Survey</h3>
          <p>Remember pairs of opposing concepts valued as positive or negative, in which Hera-FFX obtanined a 50/50.</p>
          <p>With the low fidelity prototype these figures changed up to 86% positive concepts, 10% negative concepts and  4% of neutral concepts.</p>

          <h3>Comments from users</h3>
          <p>The comments were collected in the same way, free response questions.</p>
          <p>These comments were negative without any positive. We also collected some suggestions</p>

          <h2>Medium fidelity prototype</h2>
          <p>In this iteration some errors were fixed. It is computer-based, so it included colors, a higher level of detail and was interactive.</p>
          <p>At this point the study finished. This prototype would serve as the basis for future design.</p>
