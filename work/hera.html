          <h1>Standalone HERA</h1>
          <p>HERA is a semi-automatic accessibility evaluation tool originated from the Firefox plugin HERA-FFX</p>

          <h2>Hera-FFX usability problems</h2>
          <p>What made using a tool, which presents many of the features desired by web accessibility consultants, a tedious job? The answer was clear: a usability below average and clearly improvable.</p>
          <p>But wait, how do I knew that? Well, I got to work and conducted a usability problems analysis</p>
          <p>This analysis consisted of three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</li>
            <li>An AttrakDiff Survey</li>
            <li>Comments from users</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</h3>
          <p>Ten statements. Five positives and five negatives to which the user must respond on a scale from one to five what is his or her level of agreement with each sentence. This results in a score</p>
          <p>The average score of more than 500 SUS studies is 68. Hera-FFX scored 53'5. According to the percentile range, Hera-FFX did not reach a D. Which means it failed the survey.</p>
          <img src="../img/work/hera/sus_survey.png" class="img-responsive center_img" alt="Hera-FFX SUS Score. Minimum: 2'5, average: 53'49 and maximum: 90">

          <h3>AttrakDiff Survey</h3>
          <p>Twenty-eight pairs of opposing concepts valued as positive or negative. Complicated Vs. Simple, Ugly vs. Attractive, etc.</p>
          <p>The user indicates which concept is closer to his or her perception and how close it is.</p>
          <p>Half of the concepts were positives and the other half negatives.</p>

          <h3>Comments from users</h3>
          <p>The comments were collected through free response questions. In general, those were negatives.</p>
          <p>"It takes a too much time", "Too much clicks are needed", "The UI is ugly and obsolete" and "The tool is not friendly" are some examples.</p>
          <p>Only one user, among 57 young Europeans, said positives comments.</p>
          <p>As a result, I made a series of improvements proposals. Those proposals were focus on efficiency, automatisms, accessibility, help and feedback and graphic design.</p>

          <h2>Context of Use Analysis</h2>
          <p>This analysis consisted of three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users</li>
            <li>Task</li>
            <li>Environment</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Users</h3>
          <p>I needed to know which were their characteristic and necessities</p>
          <p>I used Personas technique. It led me to set up two clearly defined user profiles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Andrea as an expert user</li>
            <li>Nicolas as an novice user</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Task</h3>
          <p>I also needed to know what the tasks of users of this kind of tools usually are and how were organized. Being these tasks: Browse, begin an automatic evaluation, test success criteria, etc.</p>
          <p>I designed two different scenarios with essentials tasks.</p>

          <h3>Environment</h3>
          <p>Although there were restrictions none of them were especially relevant to be mentioned at this point.</p>

          <h2>Low fidelity prototype</h2>
          <p>Before designing the low fidelity prototype, I proposed a layout scheme, which characteristics satisfied many of the needs, and a Navigation map in order to describe the <acronym title="Information Architecture">IA</acronym> and connect the interaction contexts.</p>
          
          <h3>Layout scheme</h3>

          <img src="../img/work/hera/eval_window_&_fails_tech_list.jpg" class="img-responsive center_img" alt="Main evaluation window (left) - List of faults and sufficient techniques (right)">

          <h3>Navigation map</h3>
          <img src="../img/work/hera/nav_map.jpg" class="img-responsive center_img" alt="Navigation map">

          <h3>Paper-based prototype</h3>
          <p>Now you can see some screens from the prototype used for the usability tests. It developed the scenarios. The user interacted with it by tapping the elements.</p>
          <img src="../img/work/hera/lofi_proto.png" class="over_img" alt="Low fidelity prototype screens">

          <h2>User tests</h2>
          <p>One facilitator and an observer conducted the user tests.</p>
          <p>In the test, we studied the interaction of five people with the low fidelity prototype. Three of them were accessibility expert and two novice students.</p>
          <p>We got ready the tasks list, the surveys, the observer sheet and we even made an evaluation protocol. Oh! There was a pilot test too.</p>

          <h2>Get to the point. Results</h2>
          <p>I'm going to keep the same structure in order to facilitate the comparison. Let's recap:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</li>
            <li>The AttrakDiff Survey</li>
            <li>The comments from users</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</h3>
          <p>The Hera-FFX average scored was 53'5. Hera standalone got an average of 65'6.</p>
          <p>This mean 7'5 points more, an improvement of 12% in the percentile range. Now it get slightly over C, which mean Standalone Hera pass it, and almost reach the SUS average.</p>
          <p>But let's calm down. It is necessary to realize that these surveys were made with a considerable smaller sample. It is less representative. In addition, we are comparing a prototype with closed task and less time of use with a real tool with real tasks and more, more time of use.</p>
          <img src="../img/work/hera/sus_survey_2.png" class="img-responsive center_img" alt="Hera-FFX SUS Score. Minimum: 2'5, average: 53'49 and maximum: 90. Standalone Hera SUS Score. Minimum: 57'5, average: 65'63 and maximum: 77'5.">
          
          <h3>AttrakDiff Survey</h3>
          <p>Remember pairs of opposing concepts valued as positive or negative, in which Hera-FFX obtained a 50/50.</p>
          <p>With the low fidelity prototype, these figures changed up to 86% positive concepts, 10% negative concepts and  4% of neutral concepts.</p>
          <img src="../img/work/hera/attrakdiff_2.png" class="img-responsive center_img" alt="Two charts representings the values">

          
          <h3>Comments from users</h3>
          <p>The comments were collected in the same way, free response questions.</p>
          <p>These comments were negative without any positive. We also collected some suggestions</p>

          <h2>Medium fidelity prototype</h2>
          <p>In this iteration, some errors were fixed. It is computer-based, so it included colors, a higher level of detail and was interactive.</p>
          <p>At this point, the study finished. This prototype would serve as the basis for future design.</p>
