          <h1>Standalone HERA</h1>
          <p>HERA is a semi-automatic accessibility evaluation tool originated from the Firefox plugin HERA-FFX</p>

          <h2>Hera-FFX usability problems</h2>
          <p>What made a tool that presents many of the features desired by web accessibility consultants that use it was a tedious job? The answer was clear. A usability well below average and clearly improveable.</p>
          <p>But wait, how do I knew that? Well, I got to work! I conducted an usability problems analysis</p>
          <p>This analysis consisted of three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</li>
            <li>An AttrakDiff Survey</li>
            <li>Coments from users</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>A System Usability Scale Satisfaction Survey</h3>
          <p>10 statements. 5 positives and 5 negatives to which the user must respond on a scale from 1 to 5 what is his o her level of agreement with each sentence. This results in a score</p>
          <p>The average SUS Score between different webs and tools is 68. Hera scored 53,5. According to the percentile range Hera did not reach a D. Which means it failed the survey.</p>
          <img src="../img/work/hera/sus_survey.png" class="img-responsive" style="width: 70%;     margin: auto;">

          <h3>An AttrakDiff Survey</h3>
          <p>28 pairs of opposing concepts. Complicated Vs. Simple, Ugly vs. Attractive, etc.</p>
          <p>The user indicates which concept is closer to his or her perception and how close it is.</p>
          <p>Half of the answers were positives and the other half negatives.</p>

          <h3>Comments from users</h3>
          <p>The comments were collected through free response questions. In general those were negatives.</p>
          <p>It takes a too much time, To much clicks are needed, the UI is ugly and obsolete, the tools is not friendly are some examples.</p>
          <p>Only one user, among, 57 said positives comments.</p>
          <p>As a result, a series of improvements proposals were made. Those proposals were focus on efficiency, automatisms, accessibility, help and feedback and graphic design.</p>

          <h2>Context of Use Analysis</h2>
          <p>This analysis consisted of three parts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Users</li>
            <li>Task</li>
            <li>Enviroment</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Users</h3>
          <p>I needed to know which were their characteristic and necessities</p>
          <p>I used Personas technique. It led me to set up two clearly defined roles:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Andrea as an expert user</li>
            <li>Nicol√°s as an novice user</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Task</h3>
          <p>I also needed to know what the tasks of users of this kind of tools usually are: Browse, begin an automatic evaluation, test success criteria... How they were organized, etc.</p>
          <p>I designed two different scenarios with essentials tasks.</p>

          <h3>Enviroment</h3>
          <p>Although there were restrictions none of them were especially relevant to be mentioned at this point.</p>
